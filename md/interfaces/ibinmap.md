> # Interface: IBinMap

An executable file which will be installed into the PATH
with a package install. `npm` will symlink that file into
`prefix/bin` for global installs, or `./node_modules/.bin/`
for local installs.

```json
{
  "bin" : {
    "myapp" : "./cli.js"
  }
}
```

For example, with linux if you install `myapp`,
it'll create a symlink from the `cli.js` script
to `/usr/local/bin/myapp`.
